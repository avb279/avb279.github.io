title: "Alice Bourne - My Portfolio"

Hello! My name is Alice Bourne. Welcome to my Github Portfolio.

## Scientific background

I have always enjoyed science. I have a range of personal interests from astronomy, to chemistry, to human biology.

From 2020-2024, I studied for an Integrated Masters in Biology (MBiolSci) at The University of Sheffield. My main academic focuses at this time were in palaeontology and botany. During this degree I discovered that I had an aptitude for computer programming, becoming proficient in the programming language R for biological analysis. Upon reflection after graduation, I decided I would like to use and build upon these data science skills in my future career, transitioning to apply them in the medical biology field. Thus, in 2025-2026 I will be completing the Applied Bioinformatics MSc at King's College London.

In the future I hope to work in a research environment where I can use both my scientific and computational skills.
